Overview and Goals
	Create a Data repository for NASA Hunch projects that makes collaboration easier, has version control, and has authentication for users to access their files. We can make a website that can do these things using PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL. Using MySQL we can authenticate using a database using a username and password. Using PHP we can make the website dynamic in a way that shows what files are there, what has been uploaded, and when. We can make the website look different using JS, CSS, and HTML. We’ll code the website with Adobe Dreamweaver or Visual Studio Code (depending on personal preference) and use GitHub to store all of our code. We’ll use Raspberry Pi as a server for storing information right now. We estimate the cost to be somewhere around 

Schedule
	We have a good amount of research into Django and some in PHP still looking into which is better. We hope to have at least some type of website by the initial prototype review. After that, we can start working on authentication and the dynamicity of the website. 
Risks 
	Most of the risks for this project would be problems with the website. Such as a few security problems from the database that will be used to store passwords and such. Also with file storage, we could see file corruption or just a random missing file for an unknown reason.
Methods for Communication and Success 
	We can communicate in person about what we need to do for the website and what needs to be done for the website.
