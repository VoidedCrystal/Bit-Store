# Nasa Hunch Data Repository Plan

## Overview and Goals

Create a Data Repository for NASA Hunch teams. This repository will allow the teams to store projects, data, and anything else they would like to store. Our repository will be web-based allowing users to authenticate themselves and keep their files safe. Additionally, users will be able to create teams with our website so users can keep track of project dates and team members. Our repository can be run on Raspberry Pi servers. For more information please see the More Information tab on the bottom of this document or contact us at [2070654@jeffcoschools.us](mailto:2070654@jeffcoschools.us), [2058822@jeffcoschools.us](mailto:2058822@jeffcoschools.us), [2098165@jeffcoschools.us](mailto:2098165@jeffcoschools.us). 

Goals Roadmap:

* File Sharing & Version Control  
* Dynamic Website \- Function & Design   
* Authentication  
* Security  
* File Conversion  
* Co-operative Live Editing

## Schedule \- milestones \+ how can we ensure they are reached? 

	We have done a lot of research into Django and some in PHP, and we are still deciding which is better. 
 	We hope to have a website by the initial prototype review. 
  	After that, we can start working on authentication and the website's dynamicity. 

## Roles

	Kyle \- Leader, CSS, HTML, PHP, Authentication & Security.   
	Sebastian \-  HTML dev, javascript, python, C++, CSS, Co-operative Live Editing.  
	Leo \- HTML dev, CSS, Dynamic Website \- Function & Design. 

## Risks

	Most of the risks for this project would be problems with the website. 
 	Such as a few security problems from the database that will be used to store passwords and such. 
  	Also with file storage, we could see file corruption or just a random missing file for an unknown reason.

## Methods for Communication and Success 

	We can communicate in person and through social media about what we need to do for the website and what needs to be done for the website.   
	To ensure success we will have people test out our website to ensure the login and authentication works and to test the uploading and download of files. 
 	We will also try to hack into our system to look for any vulnerabilities in the website’s security.

## More information

	Create a Data repository for NASA Hunch projects that makes collaboration easier, has version control, and has authentication for users to access their files. We can make a website that can do these things using PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL. 
 	Using MySQL we can authenticate using a database using a username and password. Using PHP we can make the website dynamic to show what files are there, what has been uploaded, and when.
  	We can make the website look different using JS, CSS, and HTML. We’ll code the website with Adobe Dreamweaver or Visual Studio Code (depending on personal preference) and use GitHub to store all of our code. 
   	We’ll use Raspberry Pi as a server to store information right now. We estimate the cost to be somewhere around
